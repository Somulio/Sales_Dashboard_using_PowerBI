# Sales_Dashboard_using_PowerBI

Project Description
In this project, I developed an interactive Power BI Sales Dashboard using the Global Superstore sales dataset. The dashboard provides actionable insights into sales performance, trends, and key metrics to support data-driven decision-making.

Key Steps Performed:

1. ETL Process (Extract, Transform, Load):
     Cleaned and transformed raw data using Power Query.
     Handled missing values, formatted data types, and optimized the dataset for analysis.
   
3. Data Modeling & DAX Calculations:
     Created calculated measures and calculated columns using DAX (Data Analysis Expressions).
     Developed KPIs such as Total Sales, Profit Margins, YoY Growth, and Regional Performance.
   
5. Interactive Visualizations & Dashboard Design:
    Designed a user-friendly dashboard with:
      Cards for key metrics (Total Sales, Profit, Orders, etc.)
      Charts (Bar, Line, Pie, and Map visuals) for trend analysis.
      Slicers & Filters for dynamic data exploration (by Region, Category, Year, etc.).

6. Insights & Business Impact:
  Identified top-performing products, regions, and customer segments.
  Analyzed sales trends over time to detect seasonality and growth opportunities.

Tools & Technologies Used
  1. Microsoft Power BI (Data Modeling, DAX, Visualization)
  2. MS Excel (Data Preprocessing & Validation)
